1. Arduino Mega 2560
2. 8 Servo Motors
3. DC Motor
4. Bread Board
5. Button
6. 2 Ultrasonic Sensor
7.  Leds
8. Motor Driver
9. I2C LCD
10. DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
11. Piezo buzzer

I will not upload with Circuit Wiring. Because It is so complicated. If you want it, contact me on email(saverrw2864@naver.com). So I will give you advise and help directive connection.
